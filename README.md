# Bad Bot - Drone Flying Shooter

This project was created as part of a course to dive deep into Unreal Engine's Blueprints system. In this project, we created "Bad Bot," a drone flying shooter game featuring enemy bots, projectiles, sound/visual effects, and a boss fight.

## Project Overview
- **Game Type**: 2D/3D flying shooter
- **Features**:
  - Spawning enemy bots
  - Firing projectiles
  - Sound and visual effects (e.g., impacts and explosions)
  - Boss fight to complete the level
  - Collision management using Unreal Engineâ€™s physics system

## Key Learning Areas
This project covers several important aspects of Unreal Engine development, including:
1. **Class Hierarchy**: Understanding Actors, Pawns, Game Modes, and Controllers.
2. **Input Binding**: Binding inputs from keyboard, mouse, and controllers using Unreal Engine's Enhanced Input System.
3. **Collision Framework**:
   - Physics vs. query systems
   - Collision complexity and optimization
   - Custom collision channels and profiles
   - Performance optimizations for collision handling

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BadBot_UnrealBlueprints_Game.git
    ```
2. Open the `.uproject` file in Unreal Engine 5.4.
3. Press "Play" to test the game and experience the drone flying shooter!

## Notes
- This project was built using Blueprints, with no C++ code.
- Some of the assets used are course-specific and may not be available for reuse.
